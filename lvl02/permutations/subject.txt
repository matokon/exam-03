-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will print all the permutations of the string given
as argument.

Each permutation must be printed on a separate line.

The order of the permutations is not important.

If the string contains duplicate characters, you still have to print all
possible arrangements (including duplicates).

If there is no argument or the string is empty, the program should not print anything.

Example:

$> ./permute abc | cat -e
abc$
acb$
bac$
bca$
cba$
cab$

$> ./permute ab | cat -e
ab$
ba$

$> ./permute a | cat -e
a$

$> ./permute "" | cat -e
$>
